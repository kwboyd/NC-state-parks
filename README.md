This project helps users learn about North Carolina state parks and plan potential road trips to each of them. I created this app because of my passion for local parks and the natural beauty of North Carolina that often goes unappreciated. I didn't realize before I began creating this app that no matter where you live in NC, there are at least a few parks within driving distance for a day trip. My hope is that this app will allow others to realize this too.

### Technical information
This app was built using Vue.js and Webpack. The parks' information is stored in a JSON that is loaded in through Axios. Adding a park to the trip sends a request to the Google Maps Directions API, which sends back legs of the route. The app draws a polyline on the map based on those legs and also adds up the total time and distance based on the API response. I also used Bulma as a CSS framework.
